# Bionic-Cell-Unity-Files
WIP

This is for a game that I'm making called Bionic Cell. It features robotic white blood cell that is capable of equipping multiple items at a time on four ports or spikes that surround the cell. The goal of the game is to kill all of the germs in each level (each level takes place in the human body).

Made in Unity.
